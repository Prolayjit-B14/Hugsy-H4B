            <p>Emma loves stories, but reading in class makes her nervous. Today, her teacher asks her to read a short paragraph aloud.</p>
            <p>She feels her heartbeat quicken as she looks at the words. Sometimes, the letters seem to dance on the page, making it hard for her to read.</p>
            <p>Her best friend Max smiles at her from across the room, encouraging her. She knows she has two choices.</p>
